                    Hello everybody, this is Fernando Peniche struggling to get going with his first "alive" webpage. This is my first work, so I hope you guys forgive some of the flaws it may present, but as I get better in the art of codin, because believe me, it is an art; I promise you I will improve it and give it better visuals and enhance it with all posible features I can get my hands to.

                    Let me tell you something about me. I was born in Mexico City, yeah, that big city with lots of issues, but, at the same time, lots of cool things to do and enjoy, and great, friendly people. My mother still lives there. I have one sister and she lives in Dubai with her husband and two beautiful kids, my nephews (boy and girl). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like sports: soccer, tennis, football, car racing being my favorites. I do information systems consulting for living, especially SAP and its satellite technologies. This front-line coding craziness was a natural next step for me.
